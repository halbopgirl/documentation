# Overview

This page is an overview of the Modal App.

## Getting Started

Go into the modal-app folder using Visual Studio Code or another IDE and run 
```bash
npm start
```
to run the app at http://localhost:3000/

Or **try the app immediately** on **[https://doetschman-modalapp.netlify.app/](https://doetschman-modalapp.netlify.app/)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

- Jest
```bash
npm install jest
```

- Babel

npm install babel
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd modal-app
npm start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. 

The `npm start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
