# Future Directions

Were I to have more time to dedicate to this project, there is a number of things I would implement to improve the app's quality: 

## Potential Improvements

- Implement i18next to ensure text will be translated into multiple languages
- More refinement of text size/behavior on smaller screen sizes to improve responsiveness
- Implementing a CSS framework like Sass or CSS modules to make CSS more organized and easier to use
- Create a color library/design system and change colors to variables
- Introduce snapshot testing
- Scrollbars could be styled to be more elegant/aesthetic
- Link to documentation from modal site
- Make button/hover text customizable via prop
- Make documentation site mobile responsive
- Fix some mobile-specific styling issues that don't show up in browser
- Usability testing and consumer feedback
- Add functionality to close popup modal when area outside of modal is clicked
- Use jsdoc and comments to make code well-commented and more easily usable for other developers
- Update file naming on documentation site
- Allow user to open tooltip modal using enter key when text is tabbed onto
