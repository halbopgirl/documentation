# Future Directions

Were I to have more time to dedicate to this project, there is a number of things I would implement to improve the app's quality: 

## Test Example

- Implement i18next to ensure text will be translated into multiple languages
- More refinement of text size/behavior on smaller screen sizes to improve responsiveness
- Implementing a CSS framework like Sass or CSS modules to make CSS more organized and easier to use
- Introduce snapshot testing
- Scrollbars could be styled to be more elegant/aesthetic
- Link to Documentation from modal site
- Make button/hover text customizable via prop
- Make documentation Site Mobile Responsive
